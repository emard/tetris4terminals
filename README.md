# Tetris for Terminals

This is minimalistic tetris for unix with VT100 (color/mono) or VT52 (mono) terminals,
ultra-light dependencies, no curses, no printf, terminal control sequences hardcoded inside.

Code is based on slightly updated:
[Pic16F628 Tetris for Terminals](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/applets/hades/webdemos/95-dpi/pic16f628-tetris/tetris.html)
and adapted to compile with LCC native compiler running on saxonsoc.
Can be also compiled with GCC and 2-3 warnings.
